**Subject: Service Disruption for Flask Application**
**Status:** Resolved
**Time:**
The service disruption affecting our Flask application has been resolved, and the service
is now operating normally.
The outage was caused by a faulty code deployment, which has been rolled back. We are
conducting a full post-mortem to identify and implement preventative measures to
ensure this does not happen again.
Thank you for your patience.
